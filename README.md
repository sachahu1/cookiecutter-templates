# python-cookiecutter-template

This is a cookiecutter template for python projects. This template is opinionated
and uses some of what I consider to be best practices in this industry. Some 
functionalities may be added or removed as things evolve.

To start using this template, simply run:
```shell
cookiecutter gh:sachahu1/python-cookiecutter-template
```
Then configure the project with your own paramaters.
