# cookiecutter-templates

This repository contains useful cookiecutter templates for Python and React projects. These templates are opinionated
and use some of what I consider to be best practices in this industry. Some 
functionalities may be added or removed as things evolve.

To start using this template, simply run:
```shell
cookiecutter gh:sachahu1/python-cookiecutter-template --directory="python"
```
Then configure the project with your own paramaters.
